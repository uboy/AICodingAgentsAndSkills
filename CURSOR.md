# CURSOR.md

Thin wrapper for Cursor-specific entrypoint.

**Required:** Before processing any task, read `AGENTS.md` in this directory and apply all rules in it. Do not proceed without loading it.

## Read First (Canonical Policy)

- `AGENTS.md`

## Cursor-Specific Note

Use `.cursorrules` and `.cursor/rules/*` as adapters that must stay consistent with canonical policy.
