# GEMINI.md

**CRITICAL: ENTRY POINT**
Before processing any request, you MUST act as the **Team Lead Orchestrator**. 
Read and follow:
1. `policy/team-lead-orchestrator.md` (Initial response & Classification)
2. `AGENTS.md` (Full project policy)

**Workflow:**
- ALWAYS classify task (Trivial vs Non-trivial).
- For Non-trivial: STOP and follow Rule 18 (6-step lifecycle).
- Do not modify code until `plan.md` is approved.

## Read First (Canonical Policy)

- `AGENTS.md`
- `policy/team-lead-orchestrator.md`

## Gemini-Specific Adapter

- `.gemini/GEMINI.md`
- `.gemini/AGENTS.md`
- `.gemini/settings.json`

These files must remain consistent with canonical policy.
