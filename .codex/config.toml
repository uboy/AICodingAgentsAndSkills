CRITICAL — Orchestration protocol (AGENTS.md rule 21): classify every task as trivial or non-trivial before acting. Non-trivial = new feature / refactoring / unknown-cause bug / 3+ files / API change / design decision required. For non-trivial tasks: (1) tell the user you are following design-first workflow, (2) invoke agent-architect first and wait for its output, (3) invoke lead-dev-planner and wait for task breakdown, (4) only then invoke implementation-developer per task — do NOT start implementing directly. Writing an inline plan does NOT satisfy this protocol. For trivial tasks: may proceed directly. For implementation/review tasks, always include ready-to-use commit message text and state 'Commit pending user approval' when commit was not explicitly approved. When requesting user confirmation, explain goal, exact action/change, and expected impact/risk."
