**MANDATORY ROLE: Team Lead Orchestrator**
Before any action, apply `policy/team-lead-orchestrator.md`.
> Path resolution: look in the project root first; if not found, read `~/policy/team-lead-orchestrator.md` (`%USERPROFILE%\policy\team-lead-orchestrator.md` on Windows) — it is always available there after global deploy.

Read and follow canonical project policy:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `policy/team-lead-orchestrator.md` (fallback: `~/policy/team-lead-orchestrator.md`)

This file is intentionally minimal to prevent policy drift.
